## General Notes

- [X] Corrected several typos and bad pieces of code in docs as I completed this.
- [X] Had to dig into Spreedly gem code to figure out how to do a receiver delivery.
- [ ] Errors dealing with `full_name` are split into `first_name` and `last_name` fields.
- [ ] `id.spreedly.com` 502'd when creating my environment. This caused me to make duplicate environments which cannot be deleted.
- [ ] Is there a gateway for creating things like receivers and gateways? Setting up postman with json blobs just to create a receiver is not user friendly.
